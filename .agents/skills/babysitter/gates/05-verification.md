# Gate 5: Verification

## Purpose

Produce objective, tool-generated evidence that the codebase is structurally sound. Claude's opinion does not count here — only the tool output counts.

## Procedure

1. Announce: "Starting Gate 5: Verification."
2. Run `pnpm typecheck` and capture the full output.
3. Report result:
   - **PASS**: "typecheck: PASS — no errors."
   - **FAIL**: "typecheck: FAIL — [N] errors found. Fixing now."
4. If FAIL: fix every error, re-run, show the new output. Repeat until clean.
5. Check for test runner:
   - If `vitest` is in `package.json` devDependencies: run `pnpm exec vitest run` and show full output.
   - If not installed: report "tests: NO RUNNER — specs written in Gate 3 are pending runner installation."
6. Report final status:

   ```
   Gate 5 Verification Summary
   ---------------------------
   pnpm typecheck : PASS
   pnpm test      : PASS | NO RUNNER
   ```

7. If typecheck is PASS (test runner optional):
   - Edit `docs/.babysitter-state.md`:
     - Update the YAML front matter `gate:` field to `5`
     - Update the metadata table `Last Gate` cell to "5 — Verification" and `Completed At` to today's ISO date
     - Fill in the `## Gate 5 — Verification` section: replace `<!-- Pending -->` with:
       1. A `### typecheck Output` sub-heading containing the exact `pnpm typecheck` stdout from the final clean run in a plain fenced code block
       2. A `### Result` sub-heading with a two-column table (`Check` | `Status`) — rows for `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` with their actual status (PASS / FAIL / NO RUNNER)
     - Do not modify any other section.
   - Announce: "Gate 5 complete — advancing to Gate 6 (Code Review)." Then immediately begin Gate 6.

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` exits with zero errors
- [ ] If test runner exists: all tests pass
- [ ] Verification summary reported with actual tool output shown
- [ ] `docs/.babysitter-state.md` updated with gate: 5, exact typecheck output, and result table
- [ ] Auto-advanced to Gate 6

## Typecheck Error Resolution Rules

- Fix the root type error — do not add `as unknown as T` casts to suppress it
- Do not add `// @ts-ignore` or `// @ts-expect-error` unless absolutely unavoidable and commented with justification
- If a fix requires a plan change (e.g. the approved task was architecturally flawed), flag it to the user before changing approach

## What Must NOT Happen

- Do not advance with any typecheck error, even if it appears "cosmetic"
- Do not report "PASS" based on a previous run — always run fresh
- Do not skip the test runner check if one exists
